With the second screen (the screen where the user selects I can teach or I want to learn) ->

it should be tabs or accordion? Anything would have worked in this case, but I had to think what if the user selects a wrong option the first time.
with accordion the user has to go to the bottom to select another option but with the tabs the position is fixed and user has to just select another tabs.
Going with tab, did some reading from http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/6093/accordions-vs-tabs
